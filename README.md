ðŸ§© Useful npm Scripts
npm run test             # Run all tests
npm run allure:generate  # Generate Allure report
npm run allure:open      # Open Allure report in browser

### Add these scripts to your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "test": "npx playwright test",
  "allure:generate": "allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report",
  "allure:open": "allure open allure-report"
}

### Notes

The Allure report is based on test metadata and steps; enrich your tests with labels, steps, and attachments for better clarity.

If you are testing APIs, refer to the tests/api/ folder.

Playwright automatically installs required browsers on the first run.

For CI integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.), additional setup is required â€” contact the maintainer or see CI documentation.
